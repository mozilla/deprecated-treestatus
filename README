Tree Status
===========

This is a simple wsgi app to maintain the open/closed state of development
trees. It has a simple REST API, and a friendly web interface.

Deployment
==========
The vendor library should contain all the pure python dependencies required.
The vendor library is provided as a git submodule. To check this out run

    git submodule update --init vendor

It's recommended to create a new virtual environment to install the compiled
dependencies.

    pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt

Copy who.ini.example to who.ini and edit to your liking. In particular,
audiences should match the public url of the site.
NB: http://127.0.0.1 is not treated the same as http://localhost for testing!
secret should also be changed to something random.

python testapp.py for local testing

treestatus.wsgi-dist can be used as a template for wsgi deployments

You will need to create an account for yourself in whichever database you have
created. For example, with the default testapp.py settings you would have a
database created called treestatus.db. You would then use the sqlite3 command
to add an account for yourself:

    sqlite3 treestatus.db "insert into users (name, is_admin, is_sheriff) values ('me@example.com', 1, 1)"

You will need to add at least one tree to the trees database to actually use treestatus:

    sqlite3 treestatus.db "insert into trees (tree, status, reason, message_of_the_day) values ('mozilla-central', 'open', '', '')"

Instances
==========
Production: https://treestatus.mozilla.org/
Stage: https://treestatus.allizom.org/
Dev: https://treestatus-dev.allizom.org/

Dev is updated automatically on a cron with new pushes to the Github master branch.
Stage and Production are manually updated by filing a bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Infrastructure%20%26%20Operations&component=WebOps%3A%20Other
